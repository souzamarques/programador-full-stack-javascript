                    From its launch on May 14, 1973, until the return of its third and final crew on 
                    Feb. 8, 1974, the Skylab program proved that humans can live and work in outer space 
                    for extended periods of time.

                    Skylab served as the greatest solar observatory of its time, a microgravity lab, a 
                    medical lab, an Earth-observing facility, and, most importantly, a home away from home 
                    for its residents.
